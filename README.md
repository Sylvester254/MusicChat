# MusicChat
## Description of the project: 
> MusicChat is a web application that allows users to listen to their favorite music while chatting with friends in real-time. With MusicChat, users can search for and stream their favorite music tracks from Spotify's music catalog, and communicate with their friends using Twilio's messaging APIs. The application is built using Python and Flask, and includes a database for storing chat messages and music data.

## Learning Objectives:
By working on MusicChat, we aim to develop our skills in Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as gain experience in integrating with third-party APIs such as Spotify and Twilio. Additionally, we hope to learn about designing user interfaces, working with databases, and deploying web applications.
